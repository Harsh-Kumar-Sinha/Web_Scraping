            "Why won't Anthem share information with me about the care/coverage of family members?": "If you\u2019re the primary person on your policy, you can view your info as well as some of your dependents\u2019. When dependents are over 18, we have certain privacy rules in place that may restrict your access. But you can always change that by having that dependent log into their own profile and change who can view their info.",
            "How do I use my prescription benefits?": "When your prescriber gives you a prescription for a drug, take it to a pharmacy in your network. Show your member ID card so the pharmacist can access your benefits. If you have medications that you take regularly, you may be able to have them conveniently and securely shipped to a location of your choice.",
            "What happens to my group health benefits when  I turn 65 and /or become eligible for Medicare?": "By law you\u2019re allowed to keep your group health benefits even when you\u2019re eligible for Medicare. Some plans work well with Medicare benefits, or there may be reasons to keep your other coverage. Send us a quick message by logging in and going to your message center. Or you can call us at the number on your ID card.\n\n\r\n\tReminder: If your group benefits end and you\u2019re eligible to enroll in Medicare Part B, do it within 80 days after your group health benefits end - or you could pay more.",
            "What happens to my coverage if I move out of the area?": "Typically, if you are the subscriber continuing with the same employer, and you move outside of the area we serve, if your place of employment is not located within the service area, your coverage and your dependents' coverage terminates as of your moving date. Potentially, your coverage may be picked up by the local Blue Plan (visit bcbs.com for details). If you are a covered dependent and you move out of the service area, you may still be eligible for coverage. Check your contract or Certificate for more information.",
            "What happens to my coverage if I quit my job or I'm laid off or fired?": "Check with your employer, as well as your contract or Certificate for more information. There is a federal law known as COBRA which might apply. If COBRA applies to you, you have an opportunity to remain covered under your employer's coverage for some period of time, provided you pay the full amount of your premium. You may also be eligible to convert to an individual policy of coverage offered by Anthem. This is typically known as a \"conversion privilege\".\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\r\n\tNote: If a service was authorized by us before termination, 
    but is not rendered until after your coverage ends, Anthem is not responsible for paying benefits for such services.",
            "What happens to my coverage if I retire?": "Check your contract or Certificate for more information. There are several possibilities:\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\tIf you are eligible under a federal law known as COBRA, you may have an opportunity to remain covered under your employer's coverage for some period of time, provided you pay the full amount of your premium.\n\r\n\t\t\tYour employer may offer retiree coverage.\n\r\n\t\t\tYou may have the opportunity to convert to an individual policy offered by Anthem.\n\r\n\t\t\tYou may have the opportunity to continue coverage under your group coverage.\n\r\n\tContact your employer or Customer Care for more information and for eligibility guidelines that apply to you.",
            "What if I become disabled?": "If you are the employee through whom you and your dependents are receiving benefits, you will need to check your contract or Certificate and talk to your employer for more information. If a covered dependent becomes disabled, coverage for that dependent may continue while your coverage is in force until the dependent is Medicare eligible. Contact your employer or Customer Care for more information and for eligibility guidelines 
    that apply.",
            "What happens to the coverage if my spouse and I divorce?": "Typically, if your spouse was covered under your health benefit plan, he/she would cease being eligible for coverage through your contract upon the divorce. However, because of a federal law known as COBRA which might apply, your former spouse may be able to retain independent coverage under your employer's coverage for some period of time, provided he or she pays the full amount of their premium. He or she might also be able to obtain coverage through his/her employer, through other affiliations, or purchase individual coverage. He or she may also be eligible to convert to an individual policy of coverage offered by Anthem.\n\n\r\n\tIf new coverage is obtained within certain time frames, waiting periods and medical underwriting might not apply. Contact your employer, your Certificate or Customer Care for more information and for any guidelines that apply.",   
            "Do I have coverage for pre-existing conditions?": "Check your contract or Certificate. If you are covered through an HMO benefit design, pre-existing conditions will be covered. In other types of product designs, it will depend on what your contract says, and whether or not you were covered by another contract prior to being covered through your current contract. Contact Customer Care for more information and for guidelines that apply to you.",
            "What are utilization management, utilization review and medical necessity review?": "Here's what it all means and how it works.\n\nTo see if the health care or service your doctor or other health care provider wants to give you is a \u201cmedical necessity,\u201d Anthem looks at requests for authorization. Check your Evidence of Coverage or benefit booklet to know what makes something a \u201cmedical necessity\u201d and when care requires this review.\nA \u201cmedical necessity review\u201d may be called utilization review (UR), utilization management (UM), or medical management. It is a review process that helps decide if a certain outpatient care, inpatient hospital stay, technology or procedure is medically needed.\nReviews can happen at different times including:\n\nWhen a service, treatment or procedure is asked for or planned ahead. We call this prospective or pre-service review.\nDuring the course of care. We call this inpatient or outpatient ongoing care review.\nAfter care or services have been given. We call this retrospective or post-service review.\n\nWith so many different things to consider, it may help to get a clear picture of what to expect and how the process works.\n\nTiming matters.\n\nWe\u2019re committed to deciding cases quickly. Here are types of reviews and time frames you can expect. (The maximum time allowed for a health plan to decide medical necessity once it gets the information needed.)\nNon-urgent pre-service (before care):\n\n5 business days for fully-insured and HMO/POS plans\n15 calendar days for self-funded plans (unless otherwise stated in your Evidence of Coverage or benefit booklet)\n72 hours for non-urgent prescription drug requests for fully-insured and HMO/POS plans\n\nUrgent pre-service (before care):\n\n72 hours\n24 hours for urgent prescription drug requests for fully-insured and HMO/POS plans\n\nUrgent inpatient or outpatient ongoing care (during care):\n\n24 hours (in some cases) or no later than within 72 hours of getting a request\n\nRetrospective/post-service (after care):\n\n30 calendar days\n\n\nWhat happens if there is a delay?\n\nIf we don\u2019t have the information we need to make a decision, we 
    try to get it from the doctor or other health care provider who requests the service or care.\nWe\u2019ll write you and the requesting doctor or health care 
    provider if there might be a delay because the information we need is not easy to get. This letter tells you what we need to make a decision. It also explains when to expect the decision once we get the information.\nIf we don\u2019t get the information we need, we will send a final letter explaining that we are 
    unable to approve access to this benefit because we don\u2019t have enough information.\n\nProfessional reviewers decide\n\nQualified licensed health care professionals and doctors from Anthem Blue Cross and the medical group (or their peers) review requests and give an opinion specific to a medical condition, procedure and/or treatment under review. If the reviewer is unable to decide the medical necessity of a request, he or she may call the requesting doctor or other provider to discuss the case. In many cases, medical necessity can be determined after this call.\nDecisions are based on what is right for each member for the type of care and service. Medically necessary review decisions made by Anthem Blue Cross are based on:\n\nAnthem\u2019s medical policy criteria and guidelines (reviewed at least once a year and updated as standards and technology change).\nNationally recognized clinical guidelines approved by a committee including practicing doctors and health care professionals not employed by Anthem Blue Cross.\nYour health benefits.\n\nEmployees, consultants or other providers are not rewarded or offered money or other incentives for denying care or a service, or for supporting decisions that result in using fewer services. Also, Anthem doesn\u2019t make decisions about hiring, promoting or firing these individuals based on the idea or thought that they will deny benefits.\n\nMedical necessity doesn\u2019t mean payment or coverage\n\nIf we find services are medically necessary, it doesn\u2019t mean the service is paid for or covered. Payment is based on the terms of your coverage at the time of service. There are some exclusions, limitations and other conditions that are part of your benefits. You will find them in your Evidence of Coverage or benefit booklet.\nPayment of benefits could be limited for a number of reasons, such as:\n\nInformation included with the claim differs from that given at time of review.\nThe service performed is not covered.\nYou\u2019re not eligible for coverage when the 
    service is given.\n\n\nDecisions not to approve are put in writing\n\nIf we find the service is not a medical necessity, you and your doctor or health care provider requesting it will be sent written notice within two business days of the decision. This written notice has:\n\nA clear and simple explanation of the reason for the decision.\nThe name of the criteria and/or guidelines used to make the decision and instructions for how to get a written copy.\nInformation 
    on how to appeal the decision and about your rights to an independent medical review.\nSpecific parts of the contract that exclude coverage if the denial is 
    based upon benefit coverage.\n\n\nTo see our guidelines\n\nAnyone can see our medical necessity guidelines for specific services.\nView our guidelines here.

            "Who's eligible for continuity/transition of care?": "To help ensure continuity/transition of care, we have in place a Transition Assistance Program 
    for newly-covered members that may allow them, if eligible, to continue to see their treating doctor or health professional even though that provider is not 
    part of their new health plan. This Transition Assistance Program is limited to situations where the member was receiving services for certain medical/behavioral conditions at the time their new coverage became effective. It allows in-network benefits for a defined period of time when the treating provider is not part of the Anthem Blue Cross participating provider network and there are clinical reasons preventing immediate transfer of care to another provider who is a participating provider. In addition, the non-participating provider and Anthem would need to agree on payment terms. Members who had the option to continue with their previous health plan or provider and instead chose to change health plans or providers are not eligible for the Transition Assistance Program.\nEffective January 1, 2018 we expanded our Transition Assistance Program to include newly-covered members under an Individual health care service plan contract whose prior coverage was terminated when their health benefit plan was withdrawn from the market.\nContinuity/transition of care may also be provided for members who experience a network disruption with their Primary Medical Group (PMG), Independent Physician Association (IPA), or hospital as a result of a closure or terminated contract with Anthem Blue Cross. Interested members may complete our Continuity/Transition of Care Request Form which provides valuable information needed by our staff in order to initiate the continuity/transition of care process.",
            "How do I request continuity/transition of care?": "We understand the importance of maintaining the patient/doctor relationship.

Also, your plan comes with tools to help you find quality care at a lower cost.\n\n\n\tIf you still 
    have money left in your account, it stays in there for next year and beyond. And you can also take it with you if you change health plans. View IRS rules on

If they don't have a contract with us, they're outside of our network - or out of network providers.",

You may need to contact your PCP to get an OK (prior authorization) before you get certain services.\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\r\n\tMost PCPs are family or general practitioners, internists or pediatricians. These types of doctors have gone to school to learn about all areas of health.

            "Are generic medications as safe and effective as brand-name drugs?": "Yes. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will not approve a generic drug unless it\u2019s A-rated (\"therapeutically equivalent\"). It must be identical to the brand-name version \u2014 same active ingredients, dosage and strength and medical effect.",
            "Why are generic drugs important?": "Depending on their plan design, members can help control the amount they pay for their prescriptions by requesting that their prescriber prescribe generic medications. Generic medications don't compromise the quality of your care.",
            "How can I request a generic medication?": "Your prescriber and pharmacist are the best sources of information about generic medications. Simply ask 
    one of them if your prescription can be filled with an equivalent generic medication.",
            "Can I have my prescription switched to a drug with a lower co-payment?": "If your current prescription medication is not a generic, call your prescriber and ask if it's appropriate for you to switch to a lower-cost generic drug. The decision is up to you and your prescriber.",
            "Can I request a brand-name drug?": "You may request that your prescriber prescribe the brand-name drug even when a generic version is available. However, you may have to pay the difference in cost between the generic and brand-name drug, plus the co-payment.",
            "What is the difference between generic and brand-name drugs?": "Brand-name drugs are usually available from only one manufacturer and may have patent protection. When a drug company develops a new drug, they're the only ones allowed to make and sell it under their \u201cbrand name.\u201d At some point, other companies are allowed to start making \"generic\" versions. Generic drugs are required by law to have the same active ingredients as their brand-name counterparts, but are normally only available after the patent expires on a brand-name drug. People using generic over brand-name medications can typically save money.\n\r\nSome plans require you to use a generic version when there is one, or you may need to pay a higher copay or coinsurance. Check your plan details to see how your plan works.",
            "What is a drug list/formulary?": "A drug list/formulary is a list of prescription drugs that we cover. This list is made up of hundreds of brand-name and generic drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We update the drug list/formulary several times a year. Our drug list/formulary 
    decisions are based first on quality data, instead of cost.",
            "What is a prior authorization and step therapy?": "Prescriptions for certain drugs (or the prescribed quantity of a drug) may require \u201cprior authorization\u201d from a health benefits plan before they can be filled. Some drugs require prior authorization because they may not be appropriate for every member or may cause side effects. Prior authorization helps promote appropriate utilization and enforcement guidelines for prescription drug coverage.\n\r\n\u201cStep therapy\u201d involves prescribing medication only after a \u201cfirst line\u201d drug is tried. In instances in which one of these medications is not effective and/or appropriate for a particular member, the step therapy requirements allow the prescriber to then prescribe a different medication.",    
            "How do I use my prescription benefits?": "When your prescriber gives you a prescription for a drug, take it to a pharmacy in your network. Show your member ID card so the pharmacist can access your benefits. If you have medications that you take regularly, you may be able to have them conveniently and securely shipped to a location of your choice.",
            "What is a tiered medication?": "Most plans have different coverage levels for drugs based on whether they're generic or brand-name \u2014 or other factors. Those on higher \"tiers\" may require you to pay more in coinsurance.",
            "What if my drug is not on the medication list?": "Our medication list (sometimes called a formulary) allows you and your doctor to choose from a wide variety of prescription drugs. \u00a0Please talk with your doctor about prescribing a drug that is on the medication list. \u00a0If a drug is selected that is not on the medication list, you will be responsible for the full cost of the drug. \u00a0You can also talk to your doctor about making a request to CarelonRx for an exception review of a drug not on the medication list.",
